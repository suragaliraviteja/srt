            <h2>Academic Projects</h2>
            <h3>Predicting Customer Loss In Credit Card Companies Using ML, R and Power BI</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Data variables for this project are merged using SQLite platform queries and taken from open source. Using well prepared R scripts, the data is further analysed using the R Platform. The data will be analysed for any missing information, and Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Shapiro tests are used to determine the data's normality.</li>
                <li>Between the dependent variable and each of the socioeconomic variables, correlation tests, including internal and partial correlation and factor analysis, will be run in order to remove independent variables with very weak correlation co-efficient, identify those with high internal correlation, and discover underlying dimensions.</li>
                <li>The number of helpful variables in each dimension will be retrieved from the screeplot, and Eigen values will be computed to estimate the amount of variation explained in each dimension.</li>
                <li>Finally, machine learning models will be developed, including regression and k-nearest neighbours, and their performance will be evaluated to determine which customers are most likely to stop using a certain credit card business.</li>
                <li>Analysis includes line graph and bar graph with the frequency of the loss occurring and percentage of the change in loss using Power BI.</li>
            </ul>
